## Client Brief: Johannes of Christos Medicine

### i. Essence & Foundation
> Christos Medicine is a sacred, heart-led platform devoted to compassion, embodied love, wisdom, and inner alignment. The website is not meant to feel commercial or promotional, but rather calm, sincere, spacious, and human. It should feel like a place of presence and trust—an online sanctuary. What I’m seeking support with is design, layout, flow, and visual expression—to bring the essence of the work into a clear, beautiful, and intuitive website. The intention is for the website to feel like a living, breathing space, reflecting sincerity, depth, compassion, and presence.
